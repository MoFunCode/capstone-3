## What I Found Instresting
I really enjoyed working on this project, it felt like something you'd do in the real world. Instead of starting from scratch, I had to read and modify existing code, then build on top of it, which taught me a lot. One thing that really blew my mind was seeing how the API actually talks to our code, you hit an endpoint, and boom, it triggers a method, passes in some data, and sends back a response. It’s like magic, but more real.
